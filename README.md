Fennel library of miscellaneous utilities, far from [Alexandria][1].

([Bunko][2] means a collection of books in Japanese.)

## Philosophy

Mostly following Alexandria's philosophy, this library aims to be:

- **Utilities, not extensions**: Bunko sticks with Fennel's or Lua's basic language
  conception. Bunko does not provide any extension such as macros for module system.
- **Non-opinionated**: Bunko follows Fennel's or Lua's conventional way. Bunko does
  not include any opinionated/specialized *languages* such as anaphoric macros.
- **Portable**: Bunko works with any Lua version/implementation which Fennel supports.

## Requirements

- Fennel: 1.4.1+
- Lua: PUC Lua 5.1â€“5.4, or LuaJIT
